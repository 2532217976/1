Cassandra is one of the students. She was very rude to me when we met. Clearly she needed to be taught some respect.

Lucy seemed like a polite young woman. She has asked to come see me in my office about a personal matter.

Debbie Harris was a known troublemaker and was the first girl to be sent to my office for punishment. She clearly had some behavioural issues and was going to need tp use my unique punishment methods to influence her behaviour.

Claire is the head of the English department and is a member of the school board. She seemed like a nice woman but was't able to control her class. I decided to spend some time with her and to teach her to be more assertive.

Sally is the head of the sports department and a member of the school board. As no men were using it, she had been changing in the men's locker room rather than with the students. She asked to continue using the men's room now that I've arrived.

Mr Mykock represents the mysterious owners of the school. They are keen to see good old-fashioned discipline reintroduced. On my first day at work he informed me that a secret camera has been installed in my office. The school's owners are keen to see that the girls are being properly disciplined. If they approve of my punishments then money will be sent to myr account. It seemed like an unusual way for a school to be funded.

Ruth was sent to the school by the government to ensure the girls were not being abused. She also had a place on the school board and vowed to vote against all my proposals. As she worked for the government then the Secretary of Education must have been her boss. Hopefully word doesn't reach the Secretary that I am working in eduction again.

Sally is the head of the sports department and a member of the school board. She is also responsible for carrying out corporal punishments. She followed my instructions very well and I thought that with a little persuasion she might be willing to use some of my more advanced punishment techniques. As no men were using it, she had been changing in the men's locker room rather than with the students. She asked to continue using the men's room now that I've arrived.

Sue is the head of the science department and is a member of the school board. She used to be one of the country's top scientists before one of her experiments went horribly wrong. She was sent to my remote school to keep her out of harm's way. She asked for the school's science facilities to be improved so she can carry out some experiments in the evening. The old headmaster was deeply afraid of her and I'm not sure she can be trusted.
