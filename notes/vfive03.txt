I overheard the twins plotting to switch places for a test. I tricked them into thinking I had not noticed, and convinced Louise that Mary had betrayed her and was going to leave the school. Louise pretended to be Mary and I couldn't tell them apart. Thankfully, the nurse told me that Mary had a small mole on her left breast allowing mr to determine which was which. From now on both girls must show me their breasts so I know which twin I am talking to.

Harriet told me that she left school early to run a successful business. The government refused to take this into account and forced her back to school anyway because she had never taken her exams.

I spotted some of the girls talking about Nina and the rumours that she burnt down her old school. Faye tried to chat with her but Nina said she prefers to be alone.

Faye seems like a sweet and caring girl. I saw her trying to befriend Nina even when all the other girls wouldn't talk to her.
