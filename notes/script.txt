First Day at School
###

>>>>>
It's your first day as the headmaster at an all girls college for troubled teens. Your PA Samantha has kindly prepared a schedule for you to help you get settled in.
###

>>>>>
1) Familiarise yourself with your office then head to the classrooms.
###

>>>>>
If a Headmaster Falls in the Woods
###

>>>>>
The old headmaster was worried he was being followed in the woods. Could he have been murdered? You decide to investigate in case you yourself are in danger.
###

>>>>>
1) Ask the staff about the old headmaster and see if anyone knows anything about his death.
###

>>>>>
Experiments gone wild
###

>>>>>
Miss Chang has complained about the lack of science facilities at the school.
###

>>>>>
1) Upgrade your science classroom by using the construction menu on your computer.
###

>>>>>
Teaching Miss Potts
###

>>>>>
Miss Potts can't control her class. Fortunately you are an expert in disciplining young women and have offered to pass on some of your skills.
###

>>>>>
1) Visit Miss Potts' apartment in the evenings to provide her with basic training.
###

>>>>>
5) Summon Priti to your office then decide how to obtain naked photos of her.
###

>>>>>

{color=#606060}4) Open the locked journal entry in the recycle bin of the old headmaster's computer. COMPLETE{color=#606060}
###

>>>>>
5) Ruth and the old headmaster were having an affair. Use the information to blackmail her.
###

>>>>>
Sue is the head of the science department and is a member of the school board. She used to be one of the country's top scientists before one of her experiments went horribly wrong. She was sent to your remote school to keep her out of harms way. She has asked for the school's science facilities to be improved so she can carry out some experiments in the evening. The old headmaster was deeply afraid of her and you're not sure she can be trusted.
###

>>>>>
Ruth was sent to the school by the government to ensure the girls are not being abused. She also has a place on the school board and has vowed to vote against all your proposals. As she works for the government then the Secretary of Education must be her boss. Hopefully word doesn't reach the Secretary that you are working in education again.
###

>>>>>
Mr Mykock represents the mysterious owners of the school. They are keen to see good old-fashioned discipline reintroduced. On your first day at work he informed you that a secret camera has been installed in your office. The school's owners are keen to see that the girls are being properly disciplined. If they approve of your punishments then money will be sent to your account. It seems like an unusual way for a school to be funded.
###

>>>>>
Mary is one of the students. She has an identical twin sister at the school called Louise. You're going to have some trouble telling these two apart.
###

>>>>>
Sally is the head of the sports department and a member of the school board. She is also responsible for carrying out corporal punishments. She followed your instructions very well and you think with a little persuasion she might be willing to use some of your more advanced punishment techniques. As no men were using it, she had been changing in the men's locker room rather than with the students. She asked to continue using the men's room now that you've arrived.
###

>>>>>
Alice is having trouble with her lessons and has asked for your help. You told her to come see you in your office to talk about her problem.
###

>>>>>
Claire is the head of the English department and is a member of the school board. She seems like a nice woman but isn't able to control her class. I should spend some time with her and teach her to be more assertive.
###

>>>>>
Cassandra is one of the students. She as very rude to you when you met. Clearly she needs to be taught some respect.
###

>>>>>
Lucy seemed like a polite young woman. She has asked to come see you in your office about a personal matter.
###

>>>>>
Debbie Harris is a known troublemaker and is the first girl to be sent to your office for punishment. She clearly has some behavioural issues and you will need to use your unique punishment methods to influence her behaviour.
###

>>>>>
1)Upgrade your science classroom by using the construction menu on your computer.
###

>>>>>
Priti as a Picture
###

>>>>>
Mr Wilson the maths teacher appears to have an unhealthy fixation on one of the students. A sweet and innocent girl by the name of Priti. He has asked for you to steal her email password.
###

>>>>>
1) Ask Miss Chang if she knows how to steal someone's email password without them knowing.
###

>>>>>
Order to the Chaos
###

>>>>>
Discipline is low and the girls are not studying in their free time. You must assert your authority and bring order to the school.
###

>>>>>
1) Increase Discipline to 20 to prevent Grades from declining.
