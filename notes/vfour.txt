Jimmy is the groundskeeper. He is from Dublin and he has a thick Irish Accent. Jimmy admitted to having problems with alcohol and gambling leading to large debts and him fleeing his home city. He claimed to have travelled the world before moving to this quiet town in the countryside. He claims to be happy living in his shack by the lake despite there being empty apartments on campus. He has a cute husky puppy named Beast. Despite being drunk most of the time he seems to do an excellent job maintaining the school grounds.
