I overheard the twins plotting to switch places for a test. I tricked them into thinking I had not noticed, and convinced Louise that Mary had betrayed her and was going to leave the school. Louise pretended to be Mary and I couldn't tell them apart. Thankfully, the nurse told me that Mary had a small mole on her left breast allowing mr to determine which was which. From now on both girls must show me their breasts so I know which twin I am talking to.

我无意中听到双胞胎密谋在考试时交换位置。我骗她们以为我没有注意到，并说服路易丝，让她认为玛丽背叛了她，准备一个人离开学校。路易丝假装自己是玛丽，我分不清他们。谢天谢地，护士告诉我，玛丽的左乳房上有一个小痣，可以让我确定哪个是哪个。从现在起，两个女孩都必须让我看她们的胸部，这样我才知道我在和哪对双胞胎说话。

Harriet told me that she left school early to run a successful business. The government refused to take this into account and forced her back to school anyway because she had never taken her exams.

Faye seems like a sweet and caring girl. I saw her trying to befriend Nina even when all the other girls wouldn't talk to her.

费伊看起来是一个温柔体贴的女孩。我看到她试图和尼娜交朋友，即使其他女孩都不和她说话。
