I witnessed Donna having a tantrum in the dorms about not being allowed out after curfew. She claimed to be a rich heiress and that her father sent her to the school as punishment for failing her exams.

The maths teacher Mr Wilson asked me to take naked pictures of Priti. The girl seemed very shy and conservative, so I thought it best to take the pictures without her knowing. I tricked her into changing clothes in my office by asking her to model new school swims suits for me. I left a camera recording her and captures some excellent nude shots and a recording of her masturbating. Clearly she is not as sweet and innocent as she pretends.
