Rachel had become much more confident with her body. I wanted to see how she felt about being seen naked by me so I made her change with me alone in the men's locker room.

Donna had a rude comment about me written on her knickers. I doubt she wrote it herself but it's presence there still deserved punishment. She refused to remove her knickers and so I allowed Debbie to take them off her and to then give her a forced orgasm using a massage wand. The whole thing was videotaped for the school's owners.
